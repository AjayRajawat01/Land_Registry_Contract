# Land_Registry_Contract
Smart Contract for land registry build using ethereum blockchain platform written in solidity and runs on EVM.

 ## Brief

 Developed a decentralized land registry solution using Blockchain which could overcome the short-comings of the existing process of land registry. Through Blockchain, it is possible to keep track of how property changes hand to hand. For buyers, sellers and Government registrars, it is easier to transfer the land ownership from a seller to a new buyer without any intermediaries. It provides immutability, auditability, traceability, and anonymity features which attracts the people around the globe to implement its decentralization feature in the land registry process. It also accelerates the process of registration and provides transparency to the system.


 ## Transactions
This step has several stages involved. There is no intermediary in between, and there is no need for any central authority to verify the transaction process. The owner of land can sell the land as a whole means there is no partial transaction. Following are the steps required:-
- **Making the land available**

     Once the Government is approving it, the landowner has the option to make their land available to other users.
- **Sending request to the landowner to purchase**
     
     When the land is available to buy, the buyer moves toward their dashboard, and in the available properties section, they search for the property and send a request to the landowner to buy it.
- **Viewing the request**

    Land proprietor views the buyer's requests and after communicating with them, plans whether to allow them to buy the land or not. They have the option to accept or decline the request.
- **Processing the request**

    Once the landowner views the requester address and if it founds to be the right one, then the seller accepts the request.
- **Buying the property**

    Once the request is approved, the buyer can now buy the property. If approved, then the amount of the property gets deducted from the buyer's account, and the amount is transferred to the land owner's account. They can check their wallet by viewing their profile. After a successful transaction, ownership of the previous landowner from the asset's list will be removed.


 ## Summary
The whole process is conducted in the form of the smart contract, which ensures that the process is immutable, secured and digitized. No one in between can tamper the data, and authenticity is maintained throughout the process. There is no human error involved. Paperwork will be reduced, and most importantly, everything will become transparent. Chances of fraud cases will get reduced. The public ledger can be used in case there is any doubt regarding the land ownership claim. The documents are digitally signed, which leads to the transfer of land title upon payment in cryptocurrency.
